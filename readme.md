<b>Introduction</b>

<p>This repo contains two scripts, which are simple wrappers around PyPdf2.</p>
<p>arxiv_pyler.py searches the pdf under the directory given by the user, 
and output the meta data(arxiv identifier, title, author and abstract) 
about the papers in an html file. The html file uses bootstrap so as to 
look much better than the raw html.(bootstrap files not included) </p>
<p>arxiv_pyler_gui.py is the gui version of the script. It does basically 
the same thing besides that it output meta data in the gui.</p>
<p>Both scripts are written in Python2.7.</p>
<b>How to run it:</b>
<p>run following command in termianal/command line: python arxiv_pyler.py </p>

<p>To run the arxiv_pyler.py, one needs Python2.7 and PyPdf2.</p>
<p>To run the arxiv_pyler_gui.py, one needs Python2.7 ,PyPdf2 and PySide.</p>
